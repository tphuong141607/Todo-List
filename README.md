# yesCode-Todo-List (created on July, 2019)

With guidance from Colt Steele - the instructor of "The Web Dev Bootcamp" course on Udemy, I successfully created a responsive jQuery based web app that uses html and css (styling/animation effect/font-awesome). The user can add new to-do, delete a to-do completely, or simply just check-off/uncheck (cross things off the list). 

Practicing ES5, jQuery, DOM manipulation and event handling are the main goals of this project.
